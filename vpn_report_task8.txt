Task 8 â€“ VPN Privacy and Security Report (UrbanVPN)

VPN Used:
- UrbanVPN (Free VPN Service)

Steps Performed:
1. Opened UrbanVPN and connected to a server in the United States.
2. Verified new IP address using whatismyipaddress.com.
3. Browsed websites with encrypted traffic through VPN tunnel.
4. Disconnected VPN and verified original IP restored.
5. Noted difference in speed and access.

Observations:
- IP address was successfully masked.
- Web traffic was encrypted and routed through US-based VPN server.
- Slight browsing slowdown occurred while VPN was active.
- UrbanVPN interface was simple to use but includes ads.

Benefits of Using UrbanVPN:
- Hides actual IP address and location
- Protects browsing on public or insecure networks
- Access to geographically restricted content

Limitations:
- Contains ads and background processes
- May not be zero-log (privacy unclear)
- Speed may vary based on location/server load
- No user control over tunneling protocol

Learning Outcome:
Learned how VPNs like UrbanVPN work to secure data and mask IP. Gained practical experience in verifying VPN effectiveness using IP tools and browser testing.
